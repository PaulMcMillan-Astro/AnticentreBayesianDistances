# GaiaRVStarDistances

Simple code to determine distances for Gaia stars from DR2 with quoted radial
velocities. The input required includes the parallax and G & G<sub>RP</sub> magnitudes.

The calculation takes the selection effects known to exist for these stars into
account.

It does not include any dust extinction.

I've now included a Jupyter notebook which shows how to download data from the
Gaia archive, format it for the pipeline, and run the pipeline

See McMillan 2018 (RNAAS) for details.
