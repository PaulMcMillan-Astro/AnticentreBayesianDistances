# GaiaRVStarDistances

Simple code to determine distances for Gaia stars from DR2 with quoted radial
velocities. The input required includes the parallax and G & G_{RP} magnitudes.

The calculation takes the selection effects known to exist for these stars into
account.

It does not include any dust extinction.


See McMillan 2018 (RNAAS) for details.
