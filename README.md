# GaiaRVStarDistances

Simple code to determine distances for Gaia stars from DR2 with quoted radial
velocities. The input required includes the parallax and G & G<sub>RP</sub> magnitudes.

The calculation takes the selection effects known to exist for these stars into
account.

It does not include any dust extinction.

I've now included a Jupyter notebook which shows how to download data from the
Gaia archive, format it for the pipeline, and run the pipeline

See McMillan (2018, RNAAS, Volume 2, Issue 2, article id. 51) for details.
